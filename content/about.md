## History

In 1996 the first version of [Voltage Noir](https://web.archive.org/web/19970522133019/http://www.msoe.edu:80/~hirschp/) went live.  It featured a few sparse notes on artificial life and genetic algorithms, a hidden page
inspired by the film "The Net", and a dancing stuffed toy called "Lion Thingy".

The technology was advanced.  Hanging off a redirected high port on a
Digital UNIX server, then over 2400 Baud dial-up (via SLiRP) to a Pentium 60
desktop Linux box named _Rasputin_.   This was the best version of Voltage Noir.

Subsequent versions had Gimp rendered graphics and cutting edge commentary focused
on the issues of the day, such as "blogs are stupid and bloggers only talk about what
they ate for breakfast"

## Present Day

So why is Voltage Noir back?  As an excuse to play with static site builders,
CI/CD pipelines, and whatever.

## What does "Voltage Noir" mean?

It is a reference to Film Noir, or "Black Film" en fran√ßais, only with _voltage_...
Some sort of technology or something.   You know _cool cyberpunk_ stuff?   JUST
like that but without the cool part.
